# Dom5SaveScummer

Little utility program to manage Dominions5 saved games.

At program start, there will be an attempt to locate the savedgames directory. If it cannot be found, you'll be prompted to point to it.

The list on the left are the games currently playable ingame. You can select one of these by clicking on it, and archive it with the "Archive" button. The archived game will contain the game's turn in its name. You can have at most 1 archive for each turn.
The list on the right are the archived games. You can select one by clicking on it, and restore it with the "Restore" button. 
Restoring overwrites the game with the same name in your savedgames folder.

The software is distributed "as is". Don't use it on saves you don't want to lose.
